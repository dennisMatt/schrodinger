EDP1 contains code to implement functional fuzzy habitat representation and connectivity analysis for "In search of Schrödinger’s patch: a functional approach to habitat delineation"
Repo contains dummy data rasters for four hypothetcal land cover types and code to simulate variance to build fuzzy landscapes from these four classes through Monte Carlo Analysis.
EDP2 contains code to carry out the real-world application present in the companion paper "Beyond the patch: leveraging functional habitat delineation in fragmentation-biodiversity research"
