Code to implement functional fuzzy habitat representation and connectivity analysis for "In search of Schrödinger’s patch: a functional approach to habitat delineation"
Repo contains simulated rasters for four hypothetcal land cover types and code to build fuzzy landscapes from these four classes to delineate patches and compute connectivity measures.
